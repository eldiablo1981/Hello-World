# Hello-World
WELCOME TO THE WORLD FOR TRADES :-)

I'll explain you what this page is for.
2 Situations what it will be used for:

1- Compare your games with mine (YOU), for trade?<br>
2- See the games I have (YOU HAVE) to trade at the moment.<br>
<br>
It's very simply, you will be able to research through all my games<br>
Displaying the results of the SEARCH in a list, that would be SUPER.<br>
<br>
<br>
💋👉 𝗩𝗘𝗥𝗬 𝗜𝗠𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗧:<br>

And what I can't do at all at the moment:<br>
Be able to COMPARE 2 LISTS OF NAMES (TEXT), and display the NAMES (TEXT) that are missing in the other LIST.<br>
<br>
That' s it, it's SIMPLE, but not on the net.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a little information:<br>
I already added my games and my data. But it will be very easy to modify them with yours.<br>
That's the GOAL<br>
<br>
<br>
So now it's up to us.<br>
Because I need your HELP  (っ◔◡◔)っ 💖
